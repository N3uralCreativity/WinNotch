# WinNotch Plugin SDK

`WinNotch.PluginSdk` is the compile-time package for building WinNotch plugins against the official `WinNotch` assembly.

## What it contains

- The real `WinNotch.dll` reference assembly used by the app
- XML documentation for the plugin-facing APIs when available
- The public plugin contracts such as:
  - `IPlugin`
  - `IUIPlugin`
  - `IServicePlugin`
  - `IAnimationPlugin`
  - `IConfigurablePlugin`
  - `PluginBase`
  - `PluginManifest`

## Install from GitHub Packages

First add the GitHub Packages NuGet source:

```bash
dotnet nuget add source "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/N3uralCreativity/index.json" \
  --name github-winnotch \
  --username YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME \
  --password YOUR_GITHUB_PAT \
  --store-password-in-clear-text
```

Your personal access token needs `read:packages`.

Then add the package:

```bash
dotnet add package WinNotch.PluginSdk --version 0.5.3 --source github-winnotch
```

## Important note

This package is for plugin development. End users should still install WinNotch itself from GitHub Releases.

At runtime, your plugin loads inside the WinNotch app and uses the app's `WinNotch.dll`. Keep your plugin's `MinimumWinNotchVersion` aligned with the app version you target.
